## âœ¨ Abstract

When it comes to proving yourself professionally, documentation that provides proof of your accomplishments or samples of your work is crucial. Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in an interview â€” they allow you toÂ ***show***Â and not just ***tell***.
